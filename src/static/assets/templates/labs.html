    <span id="u202-4">Labs are an interactive experience where you access remote environments and participate in coding exercises, development scenarios, and hands-on training in a remote desktop scenario. We offer two types of labs, depending on the course:</span>
    <span id="u202-7">External Labs:</span><span id="u202-12"><br/>If the lab session on this course is provided externally (from a 3rd party), you will be redirected to an external site. Credentials to access this lab (login and password) were sent to you in a separate email. <br/><br/></span>
    <span id="u202-13">QuickStart Labs:</span><span id="u202-18"><br/>If the lab session on this course is a QuickStart lab, simply launch the course lab and begin. No login credentials are necessary.<br/><br/></span>
    <span id="u202-19">If you need assistance in accessing a lab or never received your lab credentials, please contact QuickStart support at (855) 800-8240.</span></p>
